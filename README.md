# Fraud Detection

# Summary 
Anomaly detection helps in the early detection of critical outliers in a system. Based on the context, these outliers can be detrimental and result in loss of resources, and time through errors, fraud, manipulation of stocks, and other such malicious activities. Outliers can also be beneficial for example in investing, and arbitrage. Business decisions that leverage anomaly detection, which used to require intense human resource and capacity can now be completed in a short time through versatile models and automation.

# Industry Cases
I have conducted analysis in different industries to detect frauds, including
* Energy consumption
* Credit Card Transaction
* Mortgage Probability of Default & Fraud (pending)
* HealthCare

# Modeling Approaches:
I will perform various techniques to identify fraud and follow modeling procedures for the model development, assessment, and interpretation of the results. 
* Model development
* Threshold determination
* Descriptive statistics of the normal and abnormal groups

Python Outlier Detection (PyOD) module includes many supervised and unsupervised algorithms to detect anomalies. I will apply histogram-based outlier detection (HBOS) in this notebook. 
In HealthCare, I have conducted 
* HBOS model in the PyOD module with 4 aggregation methods to better seperate the outliers from normal and has a higher prediction accuracy. 
* ECOD model in the PyOD module
* PCA model in the PyOD module

More fraud detection models will be added...
