# Fraud Detection

# Summary 
Anomaly detection helps in the early detection of critical outliers in a system. Based on the context, these outliers can be detrimental and result in loss of resources, and time through errors, fraud, manipulation of stocks, and other such malicious activities. Outliers can also be beneficial for example in investing, and arbitrage. Business decisions that leverage anomaly detection, which used to require intense human resource and capacity can now be completed in a short time through versatile models and automation.

# Industry Cases
I have conducted analysis in different industries to detect frauds, including
* Energy consumption
* Credit Card Transaction
* Mortgage Probability of Default & Fraud (pending)
* HealthCare

# Modeling Approaches:
In HealthCare, I have conducted HBOS model in the PyOD module with 4 aggregation methods to better seperate the outliers from normal and has a higher prediction accuracy. 
More fraud detection models will be added...
